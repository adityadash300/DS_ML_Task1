*****

**Problem** : Billy has his exams coming up. He hasn’t been performing well on maths throughout the year, but this time he has an idea. He has the data of his friends and how they have fared in the exam. But when he tries to feed the data to his computer, the computer denies it and says it only understands numeric values. Now it’s up to you to help him.

1. With the given dataset, named *student-math*, import the dataset using the library pandas, and create a dataframe of it.
2. As there are three grades given, create a new column named **final_grade**, which shall be the sum of the respective three grades in the row.
3. Delete the three grades from the dataframe after step 2.
4. Replace all binary values with 1 and 0 in the dataframe. E.g. – For values having *Yes*, replace them with 1, and for values having *No*, replace them with 0. Do this for all columns having binary type of values.
5. Plot a *scatter* plot between the values of column **studytime** and your new column named **final_grade** that you created in step 2. Observe the relation between both the attributes. You can assign different colours/symbols for the points of a particular time step of “studytime” to observe it better.
6. Plot a *boxplot* of the new column **final_grade** and the column **studytime** in the same graph, and observe the difference between them.
